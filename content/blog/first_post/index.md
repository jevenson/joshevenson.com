I decided to start occasionally blogging! Ever since I've discovered the JAMstack, I've been meaning to
spin up a personal portfolio site and blog. Since I'm stuck inside due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I
decided to capitalize my time and actually get something started!

I am primarily a front-end web developer, so you'll see me write about that most of the time. I'm hoping that
if I start writing about interesting things I find, I can use my blog as a reference when I need to
remember something. Writing also helps me as a device to remember things, so hopefully I won't need to
reference material as often.

I have a few ideas lined up already.

- I'd like to write a post about CSS Border Radius. I've been a web developer for about 7 years now and I
finally understand how Border Radius is implemented.
- Eventually, I'll need to implement pagination on this blog, so I'll write about that.
- I made this site with Hugo, I want to compare it to Gatsby. They're both great tools, but each excel
at different tasks

I'll have more ideas that pop into my head as time goes on. That's all for now.
